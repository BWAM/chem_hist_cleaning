#,AE,SPIKE WAS DILUTED OUT.,
*,AE,"INDICATES THAT A QUALITY CONTROL PARAMETER HAS EXCEEDED LABORATORY LIMITS. UNDER THE NOTES COLUMN OF THE FORM I, THIS QUALIFIER DENOTES ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED OUT OF HOLDING TIME.",Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
+,AE,CORRELATION COEFFICIENT FOR MSA IS <0.995.,Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
A,AE,INDICATES TENTATIVELY IDENTIFIED COMPOUNDS THAT ARE SUSPECTED TO BE ALDOL CONDENSATION PRODUCTS.,
B,AE,ANALYTE WAS ALSO DETECTED IN THE ASSOCIATED METHOD BLANK AT A CONCENTRATION THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SAMPLE RESULT.,Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
C,AE,CONFIRMED BY GC/MS; C WITH A NUMBER INDICATES A COELUTING CONGENER PEAK,Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
D,AE,"CONCENTRATION IS A RESULT OF A DILUTION, TYPICALLY A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF THE SAMPLE DUE TO EXCEEDING THE CALIBRATION RANGE OR THAT A SURROGATE HAS BEEN DILUTED OUT OF THE SAMPLE AND CANNOT BE ASSESSED; Also for data in EQUIS (2001-2015): INDICATES AN IDENTIFIED COMPOUND IN AN ANALYSIS THAT HAS BEEN DILUTED. THIS FLAG ALERTS THE DATA USER TO ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONCENTRATIONS REPORTED IN THE TWO ANALYSES.",Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
E,AE,INORGANICS- CONCENTRATION IS ESTIMATED DUE TO THE SERIAL DILUTION WAS OUTSIDE CONTROL LIMITS; ORGANICS- CONCENTRATION HAS EXCEEDED THE CALIBRATION RANGE FOR THAT SPECIFIC ANALYSIS.,Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
F,AE,TRUE BACTERIAL CONCENTRATION IS ASSUMED TO BE LESS THAN THE REPORTED VALUE.,Changed from 'KK' 10/6/20 to standardize to single-char.
G,AE,TRUE BACTERIAL CONCENTRATION IS ASSUMED TO BE GREATER THAN THE REPORTED VALUE,Changed from 'LL' 10/6/20 to standardize to single-char.
H,AE,"ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED OUT OF HOLD TIME FOR TESTS THAT HAVE AN IMMEDIATE HOLD TIME CRITERIA. FOR EQUIS DATA (2001-2015): NOTED AS ""RESULT IS BIASED HIGH"" IN EQUIS BUT THIS  MAY HAVE BEEN USED AS A HOLDING TIME FLAG.",
J,AE,ESTIMATED VALUE DUE TO EITHER BEING A TENTATIVELY IDENTIFIED COMPOUND (TIC) OR THAT THE CONCENTRATION IS BETWEEN THE MRL AND THE MDL. CONCENTRATIONS ARE NOT VERIFIED WITHIN THE LINEAR RANGE OF THE CALIBRATION. FOR DOD: CONCENTRATION >40% DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO GC COLUMNS (PESTICIDES/ARCLORS).,Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
L,AE,BIASED LOW,
M,AE,INDICATES THAT THE DUPLICATE INJECTION PRECISION WAS NOT MET.,
N,AE,INORGANICS- MATRIX SPIKE RECOVERY WAS OUTSIDE LABORATORY LIMITS; ORGANICS- PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE OF A COMPOUND (REPORTED AS A TIC) BASED ON THE MS LIBRARY SEARCH.,Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
P,AE,CONCENTRATION >40% (25% FOR CLP) DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GC COLUMNS.,Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
Q,AE,DOD REPORTS: INDICATES A PESTICIDE/AROCLOR IS NOT CONFIRMED (>=100% DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO GC COLUMNS).,
Q,AE,"FOR RADIOLOGICAL RESULTS, THE ASSOCIATED SAMPLE RESULTS COMBINED STANDARD UNCERTAINTY EXCEEDS THE PROJECT REQUIRED UNCERTAINTY",
R,AE,INDICATES THE REPORTED RESULT IS UNUSABLE. (NOTE: THE ANALYTE MAY OR MAY NOT BE PRESENT.),
S,AE,CONCENTRATION HAS BEEN DETERMINED USING METHOD OF STANDARD ADDITIONS (MSA).,Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
U,AE,"ANALYTE WAS ANALYZED FOR BUT NOT DETECTED. THE SAMPLE QUANTITATION LIMIT HAS BEEN CORRECTED FOR DILUTION AND FOR PERCENT MOISTURE, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED IN THE CASE NARRATIVE.",Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
W,AE,POST-DIGESTION SPIKE RECOVERY IS OUTSIDE CONTROL LIMITS AND THE SAMPLE ABSORBANCE IS <50% OF THE SPIKE ABSORBANCE.,Exists in both historic EQUIS data set and ALS results.
